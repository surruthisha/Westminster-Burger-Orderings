This project is a simulation of a burger ordering system designed for a fast-food setting. Developed using Java, it features a robust implementation of queues to manage customer orders efficiently. The system allows users to:

View Queue Status: Check which queues are occupied or empty.
Add Customers: Customers can be added to the shortest queue or the waiting list if all queues are full.
Manage Orders: Customers can be removed from queues or marked as served, with stock levels updated accordingly.
Monitor Stock: Track the number of burgers left and receive alerts when stock runs low.
Income Calculation: Calculate the total income generated from sold burgers.
Data Persistence: Save and load program data to ensure continuity.
The system ensures an engaging user experience with features like warnings for low stock and an easy-to-use interface for queue management.
